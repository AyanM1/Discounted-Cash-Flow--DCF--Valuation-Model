# Credit Risk Assessment System

## Overview

This project implements a credit risk assessment system using Python. The system uses a dataset of loan data to train a machine learning model that predicts the likelihood of default.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is a sample of loan data from a fictional bank. The dataset includes features such as credit score, income, debt-to-income ratio, and loan amount.

## Modeling Approach

The system uses a logistic regression model to predict the likelihood of default. The model is trained using the scikit-learn library and is evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall.

## Interpretation of Results

The output of the model is a probability of default, which can be used to determine the creditworthiness of a borrower.

## Business Context

This system can be used by banks and other financial institutions to assess the credit risk of borrowers and make informed lending decisions.

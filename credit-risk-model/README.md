# Credit Risk Assessment & Scoring Model

## Dataset
Sample loan data with features such as amount, term, rate, grade, employment length, home ownership, annual income, and default status.

## Business Context
This project aims to assess credit risk and assign scores/grades to loan applicants using machine learning models.

## Modeling Approach
- Data cleaning and feature engineering
- Model training: logistic regression, random forest, XGBoost
- Handling imbalanced data with SMOTE
- Risk metrics: default probability, credit score, risk grade
- Model evaluation: AUC, accuracy, confusion matrix, cross-validation

## Interpretation of Results
- Higher credit scores indicate lower risk
- Risk grades (A-D) provide a quick assessment
- Evaluation metrics help validate model performance

## Usage
1. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. Run analysis notebook: `notebooks/credit_analysis.ipynb`

## Example Output
- Risk scores
- Model evaluation metrics
- Visualizations
